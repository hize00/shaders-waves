Experimenting with shaders in order to create cool visualization with nice electronic tracks, creating a captivating UX.

Shaders are small programs that process graphics data. Essentially, they are short scripts executed by the graphics hardware to generate visual output.
Things like meshes, textures, lights, and similar elements. 
A shader takes this data, along with a position, and calculates the color of a pixel for that position in the final image.
